                Semester Project<br>
                Syracuse University ✦ Sophomore Fall 2025
            </p>
            <p class="processCopy">
                This project was an introduction to combining what we had been 
                learning about design concepts and technical requirements for a 
                space. It taught us how to take a client brief and break it down 
                into design elements and terms, how to measure sites accurately, 
                create floor plans based off of the measurements we took, think 
                abstractly and creatively about the approach to the concept 
                through abstract paper models, how to use sun paths for passive 
                solar design and natural light utilization. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="processHeading underline">Design Problem</h5>
            <p class="processCopy">
                The project scope is to transform a designated portion of the 
                6th-floor studio in the Nancy Cantor Warehouse into a fully 
                realized residential environment that is both functional and 
                concept-driven. The design challenge is to create a space that 
                is attuned to the client, supports Alex’s routines, is driven by 
                a clear concept, and maintains intentional spatial organization.
                The goal is to merge practicality with atmosphere, ensuring 
                every choice that is artistic and conceptual, is also 
                intentional and technically sound.
            </p>
            <h5 class="processHeading underline">Client Brief</h5>
            <p class="processCopy">
                Alex is a 27 year old guitarist (in a band) who plays late-night 
                gigs a couple of times a week and also teaches private lessons 
                to teens some afternoons. He is earning an online graduate 
                degree in music history. Alex wakes up late when he can, listens 
                to a lot of music, collects vinyl, and reads a lot. He 
                frequently hosts impromptu small, relaxed hangouts. He likes a 
                home that feels lived in and keeps active materials visible; he 
                stays generally tidy without being fussy. He has a 6-year old 
                chihuahua named Bowie.
            </p>
            <h5 class="processHeading underline">Concept to Design</h5>
            <p class="processCopy">
                Starting from Alex’s brief, the design developed by focusing on 
                how he lives: playing music, teaching lessons, studying for his 
                graduate program, and hosting relaxed hangouts. Early ideation 
                highlighted a pattern of layered textures, visible materials, 
                and a warm, lived-in feeling, which shaped both the first 2D 
                collage and the evolving 3D models. These studies created a 
                visual language of planes, textures, layers, and geometric 
                shapes that carried through the project. Sightlines and sunlight 
                paths guided layout decisions, allowing open flow while 
                separating spaces for socializing, working, and unwinding. 
                Warmth, cohesion, and tidy, open storage support a home that 
                feels comfortable, functional, and intentionally designed.
            </p>
            <h5 class="processHeading">Who is Alex?</h5>
            <p class="processCopy">
                Alex is a hard worker that enjoys work life balance. He is an 
                artistic, outgoing, laid back, and vibrant person. He enjoys low 
                key jam/hang outs and hosting them in his artfully curated 
                space. He likes to garden to calm his mind and has a tiny garden 
                that he tends to lovingly. His need for open storage and visible 
                materials suggests ADHD or possible object permanence 
                difficulties. His dog has his own Zumiez style wardrobe and a 
                set of tiny bowties and matching leashes. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="processHeading">What are his needs?</h5>
            <ol class="processCopy">
                <li>Hang out space</li>
                <li>Open but tidy storage solutions</li>

            <h5 class="processHeading">Initial Thoughts?</h5>
            <p class="processCopy">
                This prompt felt like a mid-century meets contemporary design 
                style would fit the client. Open shelving and using the walls as 
                creative and vertical storage came to mind as well. Space for 
                books, instruments, plants, and more is necessary as well. The 
                color palette feels like it would be sunflower yellow, sunset 
                orange, shades of green, navy blue, and olive.
            </p>
            <p class="processCopy">
                For the next part of the project, we were tasked with finding a 
                painting that felt like the clients space to us. I chose the 
                painting (see fig. 1) 1964 by Charles Bunnell. It had the order 
                and complexity the prompt provided while still feeling organic 
                and provided the color palette as well.
